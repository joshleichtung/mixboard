description: Implement a feature quickly for hackathon time pressure
---

Implement {{feature_name}} with hackathon speed optimization:

**Strategy:**
1. **Minimal viable approach** - no over-engineering
2. **Use existing patterns** - copy from similar features
3. **Hardcode when appropriate** - optimize later
4. **Visual first** - make it look good quickly

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Create component with basic UI (shadcn/ui components)
- [ ] Add minimal state management (Zustand if needed)
- [ ] Hook up to API/data source
- [ ] Add basic error handling
- [ ] Style with Tailwind
- [ ] Test manually (no unit tests for hackathon)

**Remember:** Demo-driven development - make it LOOK impressive first.
